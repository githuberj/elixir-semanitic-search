# BookSearch

My implementation of semantic search from the Machine learning in Elixir book.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run docker-compose up to start postgres
  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies. This will also seed the database.
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
